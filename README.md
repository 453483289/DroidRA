# DroidRA

Android developers heavily use reflection in their apps for legitimate reasons, but also significantly for hiding malicious actions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art static anal- ysis tools for Android are challenged by the presence of re- flective calls which they usually ignore. Thus, the results of their security analysis, e.g., for private data leaks, are incon- sistent given the measures taken by malware writers to elude static detection. We propose the DroidRA instrumentation- based approach to address this issue in a non-invasive way. With DroidRA, we reduce the resolution of reflective calls to a composite constant propagation problem, which we model in the Constant Propagation Language (COAL). Once the COAL solver infers the values of reflection targets in an app, we instrument it to include the corresponding tradi- tional Java call for each reflective call. Our approach allows to boost an app so that it can be immediately analyzable, including by such static analyzers that were not reflection- aware. We evaluate DroidRA on benchmark apps as well as on real-world apps, and demonstrate that it can allow state-of-the-art tools to provide more sound and complete analysis results.
